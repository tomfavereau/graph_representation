# Graph Representation with Electrodynamic Algorithm
This project allows you to create a graph representation using an electrodynamic algorithm.



## control 

- Press <s> to initiate the stabilization process.
- Press <p> to introduce a perturbation if the graph gets stuck in a potential well.
- Press <f> to stabilize the graph step by step.
